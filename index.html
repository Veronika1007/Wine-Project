                Wine is an alcoholic beverage made out of fermented grape juice,
                the grapes are crushed in order to release their jucies.
                <strong>Alcholic Fermentation</strong> is then needed to change
                the grape juice into wine.

          <div>
            <p>
              There are five basic stages or steps to making wine: picking,
              crushing and pressing, fermentation, clarification, and then aging
              and bottling. Undoubtedly, one can find endless deviations and
              variations along the way. However, there are endless variations
              and deviations along the way that make each wine unique and can
              contribute to its greatness or mediocrity. The steps for making
              white and red wine are fundamentally the same, except for one
              difference.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wine making is a process that has been practiced for thousands of
              years and is mostly a natural process that requires little human
              intervention. The necessary ingredients for wine production are
              provided by Mother Nature, and it is up to humans to enhance,
              improve or possibly harm the natural process.
            </p>
          </div>

          <h3>Harvesting</h3>
          <div class="grid-2-col">
            <img src="/media/harvesting.jpeg" alt="Wine Harvesting/ Picking" />
            <div>
              <p>
                <strong>Harvesting or picking </strong>is the first step in wine
                making. Grapes are the only fruit that reliably produce enough
                sugar for sufficient alcohol and have the necessary acids,
                esters, and tannins to make stable wine consistently. Therefore,
                most winemakers believe that wine is made in the vineyard. The
                timing of the harvest is determined by a combination of science
                and tasting, with input from consultants, winemakers, vineyard
                managers, and proprietors. Harvesting can be done mechanically
                or by hand, but hand harvesting is preferred by many estates to
                avoid damage to the grapes and vineyard. After harvest,
                reputable winemakers sort the grapes by hand to remove any
                rotten or under-ripe fruit before crushing.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>Crushing</h3>
          <div class="grid-3-col">
            <div>
              <p>
                After harvesting, the next step in wine making is traditionally
                <strong>crushing</strong> fresh ripe grapes. Today, mechanical
                crushers replace the traditional practice of stomping or
                trodding the grapes by men and women in barrels and presses.
                Mechanical presses have improved the quality and longevity of
                wine, reduced the need for preservatives, and brought a
                significant sanitary gain to wine making. However, some
                winemakers still allow fermentation to begin inside uncrushed
                whole grape clusters before pressing them.
              </p>

              <p>
                The steps for making white and red wines are essentially the
                same until the crushing and pressing stage. To make white wine,
                the must is quickly pressed to separate the juice from the
                skins, seeds, and solids to prevent unwanted color and tannins
                from leaching into the wine. In contrast, red wine is left in
                contact with its skins to extract color, flavor, and tannins
                during fermentation.

          </div>
          <h3>Fermenation</h3>
          <div class="grid-col-3">
            <img src="/media/fermentation.jpeg" alt="Wine Fermenation" />
            <div>
              <p>
                Fermentation is the magic behind making wine, as must or juice
                will naturally begin fermenting within 6-12 hours with the aid
                of wild yeasts in the air. While natural fermentation is
                welcomed in clean, well-established wineries and vineyards, many
                winemakers prefer to intervene at this stage by introducing a
                strain of yeast of personal choosing, to better predict the end
                result.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once fermentation begins, it normally continues until all the
                sugar is converted to alcohol and a dry wine is produced.
                Fermentation can last anywhere from ten days to a month or more,
                depending on the sugar content of the must. The resulting
                alcohol level in wine varies depending on the locale, with cool
                climates producing wines with an alcohol level of around 10%,
                and warmer areas producing wines with up to 15% alcohol. If the
                fermentation process stops before all the sugar has been
                converted to alcohol, sweet wine is produced, which is usually a
                conscious decision made by the winemaker.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <h3>Clarification/Filtering</h3>
          <div class="grid-2-col">
            <p>
              After fermentation is complete, winemakers clarify their wine by
              racking or siphoning it from one container to another, leaving the
              solids at the bottom of the original tank. Filtering and fining
              are also commonly used at this stage to remove solids and clarify
              the wine. Filtering can be done with a variety of filters that
              catch solids, while fining agents such as egg whites or clay are
              added to help remove unwanted solids by forcing them to the bottom
              of the tank. The clarified wine is then transferred to another
              vessel and is ready for bottling or further aging.
            </p>
            <img src="/media/Clarification.jpeg" alt="Wine Clarification" />
          </div>
          <h3>Aging and Bottling</h3>
          <div class="grid-2-col">
            <img src="/media/bottling.jpeg" alt="Wine Bottling" />
            <div>
              <p>
                The last step in the wine making process involves the aging and
                bottling of the wine. Once the wine is clarified, the winemaker
                can either bottle it immediately, as in the case of Beaujolais
                Nouveau, or they can opt to give it additional aging, as is
                often done with Grand Cru Bordeaux and Napa Valley Cabernet
                Sauvignon. Additional aging can be done in a variety of vessels,
                such as bottles, stainless steel or ceramic tanks, large wooden
                ovals, or small barrels known as barriques. The techniques used
                in this final stage of the process are diverse, and the end
                results can vary widely. However, in all cases, the result is
                wine.

            You have probably never met one, but apparently some people are
            scared of wine. It is called Oenophobia.

          <li>
            The world's oldest bottle of wine was found near the tower of
            Speyer, Germany. It dates back to before A.D. 325 and is on display
            at the town's historical museum.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are 11 bottles sizes, from the 187ml 'split' to the
            Nebuchadnezzar, which holds the equivalent to 20 standard bottles.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are around 1,300 varieties of grapes that are used to produce
            wine.
          </li>
          <li>
            A "magnum" bottle of wine is the equivalent of two standard bottles,
            some claim that it is the optimal size of aging thanks to the
            reduced space of oxygen.
